# aframe-environment-component

A simple way of setting up a whole basic environment for your
[A-Frame](http://aframe.io) VR scene.

![gif](https://github.com/feiss/aframe-environment-component/blob/master/assets/aframeenvironment.gif?raw=true)

Make sure you are using __A-Frame 1.7.0__ or later. Then just include `aframe-environment-component.js` in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/aframe-environment-component@1.4.x/dist/aframe-environment-component.min.js"></script>
```

and add the `environment` component to an entity:

```html
<a-entity environment></a-entity>
```

That's it! :)

## Presets

The previous code will setup a default scene, but you have a bunch of already predefined presets to choose from, using the `preset` parameter, like this:

```html
<a-entity environment="preset: <name of the preset>"></a-entity>
```

You can view and try all the presets in the **[aframe-environment-component Test Page](http://supermedium.github.io/aframe-environment-component/)**. The current list of presets are listed in the next section.

## Parameters

Apart from using a preset, you can tweak the environment with many parameters, like this:

```html
<a-entity environment="lightPosition: 1 5 -2; groundColor: #445"></a-entity>
```

You can also select a preset but change some of its parameters:

```html
<a-entity environment="preset: forest; groundColor: #445; grid: cross"></a-entity>
```

This is the list of the available parameters.


| Parameter                | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **active**               | true         | Show/hides the component. Use this instead of using the`visible` attribute                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

The best way to work with them is to press `ctrl-alt-i` to open the [inspector](https://aframe.io/docs/master/introduction/visual-inspector-and-dev-tools.html#a-frame-inspector), search for 'environment' in the filter box and select it, and tweak the parameters while checking the changes in realtime. When you are happy, you can use the `Copy attributes` button or even better, copy the attributes logged in the browser's dev tools console.

## Performance

The main idea of this component is to have a complete and visually interesting environment by just including one .js file, with no extra includes or requests. This requires to store all the assets inside the js or (in most of cases) to procedurally generate them. Despite of the computing time and increased file size, both options are normally faster than requesting and waiting for additional textures or model files.

Apart from the parameter `dressingAmount`, there is not much difference among different values in parameters in terms of performance. Just keep `dressingAmount` value under watch and lower it if the performance is not optimal.
